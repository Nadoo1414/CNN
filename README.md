Project Title: Enhancing Digit Classification on the SVHN Dataset with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network
Description:

This project investigates the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve digit classification accuracy on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The SVHN dataset presents unique challenges due to its real-world nature, including variations in lighting, scale, and rotation of digits.

By comparing different CNN architectures and data augmentation techniques, this study aims to identify the most effective approach for classifying digits in the SVHN dataset. The research will involve training and evaluating CNN models on the dataset, analyzing their performance metrics, and identifying areas for improvement.

The findings from this project have potential applications in various fields, including optical character recognition (OCR), automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), and other tasks that require accurate digit classification.
